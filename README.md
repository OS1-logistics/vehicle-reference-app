✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

A reference app which demonstrates how to use the Core Participants service in order to create and manage a fleet of vehicles.

## Structure

This app exists as a monorepo containing a front end app called `client` and a backend one called `server`.

## Run Locally

Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
Run `nx run-many --target=build` to build the client and server.
Run `nx run-many --target=start` to start the client and server.
Run `nx run-many --target=start --watch` to start the client and server in watch mode for development.

To run the client and server separately, run `nx run vehicle-frontend:start` and `nx run vehicle-api:start` respectively.
